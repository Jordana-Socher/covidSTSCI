Final Project for STSCI 4740 <br/>
Henry Manley, Heather Ginsburg, Jordi Socher, Sophie Keller, Sam Meakem

## Research Question:
What can COVID-19 measures (eg. cases, deaths) and developmental measures
(eg. GDP per capita, human developmental index, etc.) infer about a country’s
corruption rating, controlling for population size? How can these predicted values classify a nation based on its GDP? How does this estimate look 2 weeks
into the pandemic? 5 months? The “end”?

## Model Specification:
TBD

## ML Techniques Implemented:
TBD (Model Selection, QDA?, Bootstrapping, LASSO?)

## Data Sources:
That Paper, World Data Bank(?)
